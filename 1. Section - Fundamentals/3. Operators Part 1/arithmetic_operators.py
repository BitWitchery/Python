# Arithmetic Operators

# Operators are used to perform operations on values.

# First we will discuss the most basic arithmetic operators, they may be familiar from math classes.
# Operator	Operation	    Example
# +	        Addition	    3 + 2 = 5
# -	        Subtraction	    3 - 2 = 1
# *	        Multiplication	3 * 2 = 6
# /	        Division	    4 / 2 = 2

# Let's see a usage example.

a = 3
b = 5
c = a + b # c holds 8
