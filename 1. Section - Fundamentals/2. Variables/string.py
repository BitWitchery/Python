# String

# A char is a single character (for example: 1, 6, %, b, p, ., T, etc.)

# The str (string) type is a special type that consists of multiple chars.

# To initialize a string value in a variable, enclose it within single or double quotation marks:

s1 = 'This is a string'
s2 = "This is also a string"

# In the above example, two string variables are initialized, named s1 and s2.
