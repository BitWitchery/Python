# Replace the values of variables b1 and b2 with numbers so that b3 evaluates to True.

# b3 will be True when the multiplication of b1 and b2 is greater than their addition.

# Replace the values with numbers
b1 = 5
b2 = 7

# This line checks if b1 * b2 is greater than b1 + b2
b3 = (b1 * b2) > (b1 + b2)

# Don't change the line below
print(f"b3 = {b3}")

# Replace the values of variables a, b, and c with boolean values (True or False) so that result evaluates to True.

# result will be True when the expression (a or b) and not c is true. 
# Use the logical operators or, and, and not to solve this challenge.

# Replace the values with booleans
a = True
b = False
c = False

# This line checks if (a or b) and not c is True
result = (a or b) and not c

# Don't change the line below
