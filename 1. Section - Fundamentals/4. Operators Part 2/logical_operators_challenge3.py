# You're helping a weather app determine suitable outdoor activities based on weather conditions. Create a program that uses logical operations to determine if certain activities are possible.

# Initialize the following variables:

#     is_sunny with the value True
#     temperature with the value 25
#     wind_speed with the value 10
#     water_temperature with the value 22

# Write the following logical expressions to determine if:

#     can_go_hiking: It's sunny AND temperature is above 15째C AND wind speed is below 20 km/h
#     can_go_swimming: It's sunny AND temperature is above 20째C AND water temperature is above 18째C
#     cannot_go_outside: It's NOT sunny OR temperature is below 10째C OR wind speed is above 30 km/h

# Initialize variables
