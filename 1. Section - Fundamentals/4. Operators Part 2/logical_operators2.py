# Logical Operators Part 2

# Logical operators have a special table called "Truth table" that shows what the combination of logical operators returns.

# Truth table for the and operator:
# a	        b	    a and b
# False	    False	False
# False	    True	False
# True	    False	False
# True	    True	True

# The only way to get a True for the and operator is if both a and b are True

# Truth table for the or operator:
# a	    b	    a or b
# False	False	False
# False	True	True
# True	False	True
# True	True	True

# In this case, to get a True result, either a or b should be True.

# Truth table for the not operator:
# a	    not a
# False	True
# True	False

# Here the value of a is reversed. If a is False then not a is True
