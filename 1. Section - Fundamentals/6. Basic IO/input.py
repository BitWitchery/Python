# Input

# As of now we stored values that we thought about in variables. 
# Programs usually don't work this way. We receive values from an outer source, a user for example.

# To get input from a user or the system we need to write:

var = input()

# This will store the input in the variable var.

#     The input is always of type string. For example, if the input is 56 then var will hold the string "56".
